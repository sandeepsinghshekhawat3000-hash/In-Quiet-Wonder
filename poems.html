    <div class="space-y-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      <p>As I have said, I am bad at Poems and i tend to repeat words.<br> But what I AM good at, is pouring all my heart into words.<br>Even if they don't rhyme, they still beat like my heart does.<br>So, here they are.</p>
      <p>1. And when I looked into those eyes, i could see a world full of love<br>a world full sweetness, a world meticulously crafted by the hands of nature<br>a symphony of the divine strings of the lyre that is fate, listening which feels like an elixir<br>how could one not get lost into them.</p>
      <p>2. The starlit night feels unfinished without the moon’s quiet elegance<br>painting the dark in silver and leaving the stars to glimmer like fireflies in a hushed forest.<br>Maybe some nights are simply meant to feel that way — gently incomplete.<br>And maybe some lights are only ever meant to be chosen.<br>Just like the moon chooses the light of the sun.<br>If one day you do choose one, I hope it’s kind to you, steady for you…<br>something you can shine with.</p>
      <p>And last but not the least, I wish I was a song that you would sing. So I could be a symphony born at your heart, the voice of your soul, and the dream of your eyes.</p>
